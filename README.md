# Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML-Pipeline-with-AWS-S3-Snowflake
This project develops a heart disease prediction model using AWS S3, Snowflake, and Machine Learning. Data is stored in S3, loaded into Snowflake for analysis, and processed using SQLAlchemy. kNN and SVM models are trained with GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning, and performance is evaluated in a Jupyter Notebook.
